3. The "Last Resort" Spoof: The Gateway Target
If you want to try to trick the distant router from afar without a tunnel, you must modify your Scapy script to target the Router's IP specifically, rather than the multicast group.

The Strategy:

Set the IP Source to the Moxa's IP.

Set the IP Destination to the Moxa's Gateway Router IP.

Set the TTL to be high enough to reach that router (e.g., TTL=10).
